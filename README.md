# EggTimer
This is an Egg Timer made using Phoenix. It features 4 preset timers for cooking your egg (runny, soft boiled, hard boiled, overcooked) and a custom timer you can use for whatever you like.

Check out https://egg-timer.onrender.com to see how it works!

## To run

To start the Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from the browser.

###### Note
This served as coding practice to know the basics of Elixir and Phoenix so apologies in advance for any inadequacies.
